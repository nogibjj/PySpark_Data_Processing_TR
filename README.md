## Overview
The project entails leveraging PySpark for data processing on a sizable dataset. The primary goals involve integrating a Spark SQL query and executing a data transformation. I am utilizing a dataset on alcohol expense.

## Preparation:
1. open codespaces
2. wait for environment to be built
3. run main.py

## Some operations
- `make install`
- `make lint`
- `make test`

## Workflow
extract -> start_spark -> load_data -> describe -> quert -> example_transform -> end_spark
